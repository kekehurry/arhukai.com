		title: "I'm Kai, an Architect, Urban Scientist, Full-stack Developer, and a Cat Person.",
		description:
			"I hold a PhD from the School of Architecture at South China University of Technology, where I built a strong foundation in urban planning and the integration of artificial intelligence into urban contexts. I bring two years of professional experience as an urban planner and previously served as a Visiting Student at the MIT Media Lab, where I collaborated with the City Science group. My research focuses on developing innovative tools for urban planning, including case-based design systems and human-centered agent-based models for urban simulation. Currently, as the creator of the CityFlow Platform, I am spearheading the creation of a low-code development platform powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). This platform empowers urban researchers to design expert workflows and craft data-driven solutions to tackle complex city challenges.",
