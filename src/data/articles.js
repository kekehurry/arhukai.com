		title: "TravelAgent: Generative Agents in the Built Environment",
		publication: "arXiv preprint",
		url: "https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2412.18985",
		description:
			"Understanding human behavior in built environments is critical for designing functional, user centered urban spaces. Traditional approaches, such as manual observations, surveys, and simplified simulations, often fail to capture the complexity and dynamics of real world behavior. To address these limitations, we introduce TravelAgent, a novel simulation platform that models pedestrian navigation and activity patterns across diverse indoor and outdoor environments under varying contextual and environmental conditions...",

		title: "Humanized Agent-based Models: a Framework",

		description:
			"This paper introduces Humanized Agent-Based Models (h-ABM), a conceptual approach integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into agent-based simulations (ABMs) to enhance the realism of human behavior in simulations. Recent works have demonstrated the capabilities of LLMs for creating powerful agents; nevertheless, they don’t propose a framework for defining agents and guiding their integration into ABMs. Surveying previous work in the field, and from the findings of LLM agents, ABM literature, and cognitive frameworks, h-ABM proposes a modular framework for LLM agents in the context of ABMs. We finally compare the framework with other LLM agents’ proposals to see how they fit into it.",

		description:
			"The campus layout is a major stage in the early stages of campus planning and design. When assessing the feasibility of a campus site in stage, we usually compare multiple campus layout schemes, which consumes a lot of time. The design process can be accelerated if multiple campus planning schemes can be generated quickly to meet the desired requirements...",

		description:
			"Taihu stone is an important landscape element in Chinese Private Garden on Southern Yangtze river, which is known for its profound cultural and aesthetic significance. In this paper, we intend to introduce the 3D spacial character of Taihu stone into architectural forms and spaces using machine learning, trying to explore the possibilities of AI-assisted 3D form finding and design latent space exploration...",

		description:
			"This research proposes a design system that combines a case-based learning algorithm with a rule-based optimization algorithm to automatically generate and revise urban form prototypes based on historical cases and user requirements. The system aims to address the challenges of existing generative methods for urban forms, such as the lack of flexibility and organicity of rule-based methods and the insufficient manipulability and interpretability of the newest GAN-integrated case-based methods...",

			"Uneven daylighting distribution in classrooms is a common issue in many countries, despite meeting the standard daylighting factor (DF). The issue has been particularly acute in China. With the development of dynamic daylighting metrics, they have been incorporated into daylighting standards in various countries... ",

		description:
			"Under the influence of globalization, the transformation of traditional architectural space is vital to the growth of local architecture. As an important spatial element of traditional gardens, Taihu stone has the image qualities of being “thin, wrinkled, leaky and transparent” The “transparency” and “ leaky” of Taihu stone reflect the connectivity and irregularity of Taihu stone’s holes, which are consistent with the contemporary architectural design concepts of fluid space and transparency...",
