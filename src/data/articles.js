		description:
			"Understanding human behavior in urban environments is a crucial field within city sciences. However, collecting accurate behavioral data, particularly in newly developed areas, poses significant challenges. Recent advances in generative agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown promise in simulating human behaviors without relying on extensive datasets...",

		description:
			"Understanding human behavior in built environments is critical for designing functional, user centered urban spaces. Traditional approaches, such as manual observations, surveys, and simplified simulations, often fail to capture the complexity and dynamics of real world behavior. To address these limitations, we introduce TravelAgent, a novel simulation platform that models pedestrian navigation and activity patterns across diverse indoor and outdoor environments under varying contextual and environmental conditions...",

		description:
			"The advent of generative agents (GAs) based on large language models (LLMs) has significantly influenced the evolution of agent-based modeling (ABM), offering new perspectives across various domains, including engineering and social sciences. This article provides an extensive overview of the integration of GAs into ABMs, emphasizing the advancements and emerging challenges in their validation. Traditional ABMs, characterized by their simplistic yet powerful approach to modeling complex systems, have been redefined with the introduction of GAs...",

		description:
			"This paper introduces Humanized Agent-Based Models (h-ABM), a conceptual approach integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into agent-based simulations (ABMs) to enhance the realism of human behavior in simulations. Recent works have demonstrated the capabilities of LLMs for creating powerful agents; nevertheless, they don’t propose a framework for defining agents and guiding their integration into ABMs. Surveying previous work in the field, and from the findings of LLM agents, ABM literature, and cognitive frameworks, h-ABM proposes a modular framework for LLM agents in the context of ABMs. We finally compare the framework with other LLM agents’ proposals to see how they fit into it.",

			"The campus layout is a major stage in the early stages of campus planning and design. When assessing the feasibility of a campus site in stage, we usually compare multiple campus layout schemes, which consumes a lot of time. The design process can be accelerated if multiple campus planning schemes can be generated quickly to meet the desired requirements...",

			"This research proposes a design system that combines a case-based learning algorithm with a rule-based optimization algorithm to automatically generate and revise urban form prototypes based on historical cases and user requirements. The system aims to address the challenges of existing generative methods for urban forms, such as the lack of flexibility and organicity of rule-based methods and the insufficient manipulability and interpretability of the newest GAN-integrated case-based methods...",

			"Under the influence of globalization, the transformation of traditional architectural space is vital to the growth of local architecture. As an important spatial element of traditional gardens, Taihu stone has the image qualities of being “thin, wrinkled, leaky and transparent” The “transparency” and “ leaky” of Taihu stone reflect the connectivity and irregularity of Taihu stone’s holes, which are consistent with the contemporary architectural design concepts of fluid space and transparency...",
